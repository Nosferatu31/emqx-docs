### Enhancement

- Boot script fail fast on invalid node name, improve error message readability

### Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that hot configuration items did not take effect after restoring from backup

- Fix connection test always passing when creating MongoDB resource in rules engine
- Fix rule engine not updating metrics correctly when writing to TDEngine resource fails

- Fix the issue that the execution order of topic rewriting and delayed publish is not fixed, now it is fixed to execute topic rewriting first
- Fix the issue that modules that were turned off in the backup file would be automatically enabled after restoring the backup
- Fix the issue that the MQTT-SN client would be disconnected when retransmitting QoS 2 messages
- Fix Dashboard HTTPS listener's `verify` option not taking effect
- Fix multiple Dashboard display issues

## 4.2.12 Release

*Release Date: 2022-07-11*

### Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that the hot configuration function cannot continue to be used after hot upgrade

## 4.2.11 Release

*Release Date: 2022-04-26*

### Important changes

- A cluster-wide total connections calculation bug was fixed in in Enterprise edition 4.2.11. Previously only the individual node's local number of connections were checked against the max number of connections allowed by the license. After this fix, the total number of connections is aggregated cluster-wide every 5 seconds. An extra 10% overrun is allowed to compensate the delays in aggregation. **Users planning to upgrade should be aware of the possibility that this change may cause clients to reach the license limit and not be able to connect.**

> Note: The WebSocket listener will be restarted when e4.2.0 and e4.2.1 are hot-upgraded to a higher version, so WebSocket connections will be disconnected for a short time, please pay attention when upgrading.

### Enhancement

- MQTT-SN gateway supports initiative to synchronize registered topics after session resumed.
- Improve the relevant metrics during the execution of the rule engine SQL matching
- Improve the error message when rule engine fails to parse payload
